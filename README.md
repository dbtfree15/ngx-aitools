# Rename titles in Paperless NGX using OpenAI

This is a Paperless NGX post consumption script.More information under this link : https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/advanced_usage/#consume-hooks.
You need an OpenAI API account to run it.

## Installation in Paperless NGX

**Download or checkout the source code:**

* Copy the directory into your paperless docker compose directory (where the `docker-compose.yml` is located).

```bash
# It will look like this
user@host:~/paperless$ tree . -L 2
.
├── consume
├── docker-compose.env
├── docker-compose.yml
├── export
└── ngx-renamer
    ├── change_title.py
    ├── modules
    ├── post_consume_script.sh
    ├── README.md
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── settings.yaml
    ├── setup_venv.sh
    ├── test_pdf.py
    ├── test_title.py
    ├── title_finder.py
```

**Create a `.env` file in the `ngx-renamer` directory and put your credentials in:**

```bash
# you can create an openai key under https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key_from_openai>
# you find the api key in your paperless user proofile
PAPERLESS_NGX_API_KEY=<your_paperless_api_token>
# the url of your paperless installation
# it must be accesible from the container
# http://<container_name>:<port> e.g. http://paperless-webserver-1:8000
PAPERLESS_NGX_URL=http://your-domain.whatever:port
```

**Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and add the directory `ngx-renamer` as internal directory to the webserver container and `post_consume_script.sh` as post consumption script:**

```bash
  webserver:
    image: ghcr.io/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - db
      - broker
      - gotenberg
      - tika
    ports:
      - "8443:8000"
    volumes:
      - /data/paperless/data:/usr/src/paperless/data
      - /data/paperless/media:/usr/src/paperless/media
      - ./export:/usr/src/paperless/export
      - /data/paperless/consume:/usr/src/paperless/consume
      # this is the new volume for nxg-renamer - add this
      - /your/path/to/paperless/ngx-renamer:/usr/src/ngx-renamer
    env_file: docker-compose.env
    environment:
      PAPERLESS_REDIS: redis://broker:6379
      PAPERLESS_DBHOST: db
      PAPERLESS_TIKA_ENABLED: 1
      PAPERLESS_TIKA_GOTENBERG_ENDPOINT: http://gotenberg:3000
      PAPERLESS_TIKA_ENDPOINT: http://tika:9998
      # This is the post consumption script call - add this
      PAPERLESS_POST_CONSUME_SCRIPT: /usr/src/ngx-renamer/post_consume_script.sh
```
**Restart your paperless system:**
```bash
user@host:~/paperless$ docker compose down

```

**To initialize the virtual python environment in the docker container you have to call `setup_venv.sh`once and after any update of the container image. Make sure that the scripts and files are accessible by `root`. Follow these steps:**

```bash
# Change owner to root
user@host:~/paperless$ sudo chown -R root ngx-renamer/
# Make scripts executable
user@host:~/paperless$ sudo chmod +x ngx-renamer/setup_venv.sh
user@host:~/paperless$ sudo chmod +x ngx-renamer/post_consume_script.sh
# run setup routine
user@host:~/paperless$ docker compose exec -u paperless webserver /usr/src/ngx-renamer/setup_venv.sh
```

**The result sould look like:**

```bash
# Shortened version of the output
user@khost:~/paperless$ docker compose exec -u paperless webserver /usr/src/ngx-renamer/setup_venv.sh

**Done! Post cosumption only start after Paperless NGX created a new document through uploads, consumptions, or mails.**

```bash
# This script should run with an 404 error.
user@host:~/paperless$ docker compose exec -u paperless webserver /usr/src/ngx-renamer/post_consume_script.sh
```

## The settings

You may edit `settings.yaml` to edit the prompt and with that the results.

**Test the different models at OpenAI:**
```yaml
openai_model: "gpt-4o-mini" # the model to use for the generation
```
**Decide whether you want to have a date as a prefix:**
```yaml
with_date: true # boolean if the title should the date as a prefix
```
**Play with the prompt - it is a work in progress and tested in Englsh and German:**
```yaml
prompt:
  # the main prompt for the AI
  main: |
    * this is a text from a PDF document generated with OCR
    * begin the text with the following line: ### begin of text ###
    * end the text with the following line: ### end of text ###
    * generate a title for that given text in the corresponding language
    * add the sender or author of the document with a maximum of 20 characters to the  title 
    * remove all stop words from the title
    * the  title must be in a Concise and Informative style
    * remove duplicate information
    * the length must be smaller that 200 characters
    * do not use asterisks in the title
    * do not use currencies in the result
    * optimize it for readability
    * check the result for filename conventions
    * re-read the generated  title and optimize it
  # the prompt part will be appended if the date should be included in the title using with_date: true
  with_date: |
    * analyze the text and find the date of the document
    * add the found date in form YYYY-MM-DD as a prefix to the doument title
    * if there is no date information in the document, use {current_date}
    * use the form: date sender title
  # the prompt part will be appended if the date should not be included in the title using with_date: false
  no_date: |
    * use the form: sender title
  # the prompt before the content of the document will be appended
  pre_content: |
    ### begin of text ###
  # the prompt after the content of the document will be appended
  post_content: |  
    ### end of text ###
```

## Python development and testing

If you want to develop and test is without integrating it in Paperless NGX you can do that.

* Create a virtual environment
* Load all libraries
* Call test scripts
* Enjoy optimizing the prompt in settings.yaml

### Create virtual environment

```bash
# python or python3 is up to your system
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Load all needed libraries

```bash
(.venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Call test scripts

```bash
# prints the thought title from a american law text
(.venv)$ python3 test_title.py
````

```bash
# read the content from a OCR'ed pdf file
(.venv)$ python3 ./test_pdf.py path/to/your/ocr-ed/pdf/file
